# GS_diffusion
This repository is part of the research conducted under the [Implicit Deepfake](https://github.com/quereste/implicit-deepfake) project. The primary goal of that project is to explore techniques for generating and manipulating 3D models using implicit representations. This experiment extends this work by focusing on the transformation of a 3D Blender model into a new 3D model using Gaussian Splatting through Stable Diffusion.

## Reproducing the Results

To reproduce the results of this experiment, you will need to install the following tools:

- [**Stable Diffusion**]([https://github.com/quereste/implicit-deepfak](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)e)
- **EbSynth**: 
- **Gaussian Splatting**: 

Please ensure these tools are installed and properly configured before running the experiment.
